<h2>Do you want to automate the manual things a person does on the internet ? Web automation is the answer for that!</h2>


I tried creating a sandbox generator which literally generates the code required to perform a certain automation. <br/>
What does the programmer have to do then you ask? The programmer decides what actions are to be performed on which element(one should know about web elements at least to use this) !That's it! And trust me ! This is really easy to use. Althought the mechanism required to make it has been completed, but I'm yet to be done with the GUI for the program. The program can still be used by calling certain python functions as I've demonstrated in the end of the program!

<br/><br/>
Via This project, I want to elaborate how programmers use automation via modules like selenium 
<br/>

The element you want to select can be (should be written in the same manner as shown) : xpath, class_name , id
The actions one can perform on the element are : click(), send_keys([what you want to type inside the element])

And don't worry if you don't know much about modular programming, The GUI will be provided soon , it will be a matter of few clicks to make a web automation flow, Just give me some time :).
<br/>
Also, you can change or modify the code as per your likings! It's open source :)!
